# FF & TK plugin
It's a sample plugin for SCP:SL servers using Exiled.
***
> - **Plugin sends message to victim and attacker about Friendly fire or Teamkilling**.
>   - The attacker receives information that he has injured someone, and the victim also receives information about WHO injured him, but of course **you can freely edit messages** in **yaml configuration**.
`Yaml configuration â†´`
